      <p class="basic"> 

	<br><br>Now this is a story all about how
	<br>My life got flipped-turned upside down
	<br>And I'd like to take a minute
	<br>Just sit right there
	<br>I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

	<br><br>In west Philadelphia born and raised
	<br>On the playground was where I spent most of my days
	<br>Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
	<br>And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
	<br>When a couple of guys who were up to no good
	<br>Started making trouble in my neighborhood
	<br>I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
	<br>She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

	<br><br>I begged and pleaded with her day after day
	<br>But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
	<br>She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
	<br>I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."

	<br><br>First class, yo, this is bad
	<br>Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
	<br>Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
	<br>Hmm, this might be alright.

	<br><br>But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
	<br>Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
	<br>I don't think so
	<br>I'll see when I get there
	<br>I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
	
	<br><br>Well, the plane landed and when I came out
	<br>There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
	<br>I ain't trying to get arrested yet
	<br>I just got here	
	<br>I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

	<br>I whistled for a cab and when it came near
	<br>The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
	<br>If anything I could say that this cab was rare
	<br>But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
	<br>â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."

	<br><br>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
	<br>And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."
	<br>I looked at my kingdom
	<br>I was finally there
	<br>To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
